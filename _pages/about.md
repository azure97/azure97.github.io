I am a fifth year CS PhD student at National University of Singapore, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Seth Gilbert](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gilbert/). Previously, I received my bachelor's
degree in computer science from Universitas Indonesia.

I am broadly interested in distributed algorithms. Currently, my focus is on Byzantine consensus.
